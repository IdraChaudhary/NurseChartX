# NurseChartX - AI-Powered Medical Chart Extraction System

NurseChartX is an advanced artificial intelligence system designed to extract and analyze structured clinical data from handwritten and printed nurse charts. This innovative solution combines computer vision with large language models to transform unstructured medical documentation into actionable, structured data.

## Overview

The healthcare industry generates vast amounts of unstructured clinical data through handwritten nurse charts and documentation. NurseChartX addresses the critical need for digitization and structured data extraction by leveraging state-of-the-art OCR technology and multimodal AI analysis.

## Key Features

- **Multimodal OCR Processing**: Dual-engine OCR system using EasyOCR and Tesseract for optimal text extraction accuracy
- **Intelligent Field Recognition**: Advanced pattern recognition for medical fields including vitals, patient information, and clinical notes
- **Multi-LLM Integration**: Support for OpenAI GPT, Cohere Command, and Anthropic Claude models for clinical interpretation
- **Structured Data Output**: Automated transformation of unstructured text into standardized JSON and tabular formats
- **Quality Validation**: Built-in data validation and confidence scoring for extracted information
- **Web Interface**: User-friendly Gradio interface for easy deployment and interaction

## Architecture

```
Input Layer: Medical Chart Images → OCR Processing → Text Extraction → Field Parsing → LLM Analysis → Structured Output
```

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Tesseract OCR engine
- API keys for LLM providers (optional)

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/NurseChartX.git
cd NurseChartX
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
```

4. Run the application:
```bash
python src/main.py
```

### Docker Deployment

```bash
docker build -t nursechartx .
docker run -p 7860:7860 nursechartx
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from src.ocr.easyocr_engine import EasyOCREngine
from src.processing.text_parser import MedicalTextParser

# Initialize OCR engine
ocr_engine = EasyOCREngine()

# Extract text from medical chart
extracted_text = ocr_engine.extract_text(image)

# Parse medical data
parser = MedicalTextParser()
structured_data = parser.parse_medical_fields(extracted_text)
```

### Web Interface

Start the Gradio web interface:
```bash
python src/interface/gradio_app.py
```

Access the application at `http://localhost:7860`

## Supported Medical Fields

- Patient demographics (name, ID, date of birth)
- Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, temperature, respiratory rate)
- Clinical observations and notes
- Medication administration records
- Assessment findings
- Nursing interventions

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# API Keys (optional)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
COHERE_API_KEY=your_cohere_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key

# Application Settings
DEBUG=false
OCR_ENGINE=easyocr
MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=10
```

### Custom Field Definitions

Modify `config/settings.py` to add custom medical field patterns:

```python
CUSTOM_FIELDS = {
    "custom_vital": r"Custom Vital[:\-]?\s*([0-9\.]+)",
    "special_observation": r"Special Obs[:\-]?\s*(.+)"
}
```

## API Documentation

### OCR Endpoints

```python
POST /api/ocr/extract
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

{
    "image": file,
    "engine": "easyocr|tesseract"
}

Response:
{
    "text": "extracted text content",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "processing_time": 1.23
}
```

### Medical Analysis Endpoints

```python
POST /api/analyze/medical
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "text": "medical chart text",
    "analysis_type": "vitals|full|custom"
}

Response:
{
    "patient_data": {...},
    "vital_signs": {...},
    "clinical_notes": {...},
    "confidence_scores": {...}
